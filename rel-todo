 o Install python files correctly

 o Build with guile-gnome

 o Pyrogen: add command line arguement to keep the coordinates from the input CCD/mmcif file

 o Pyrogen chirality: Using CCD files as input, make a dictionary and either validate the coordinates 
   (dictionary vs actual) chiral volume or minimize and validate coordinates

 o Fix Oliver Clarke Zn chirals bug.

 o I like the interactive probe dots display a lot, but I really wish it was more interactive - would 
   it be possible to add a "live" probe dots display, that would refresh every second or two during 
   real space refinement and rotamer selection? This would be very helpful, particularly as a visual 
   guide during "rubber-band" manipulation of a structure when real-space refining a zone. Preferably 
   such a function would allow one to only display bad (pink) overlaps and h-bonds, as the full probe 
   dots display can be a little distracting.  -- Oliver Clarke
