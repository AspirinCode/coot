   o lbg fetch molecule ibrutinib - fails (Cobicistat works).

   o Run Acedrg on pc-25151504.mol (possibly via lidia) and check for
     geometry distortions.  Also, and perhaps more importantly, check
     that the NBC and the H-NBCs are working properly when regularizing.

   o Does "Phosphorylate this residue" work in Python mode?

   o test: Helix atoms have correct B factor Oliver Clarke.

* Done.

   o test: can you do Ca Zone -> Mainchain on a reversed fragment of 7 
     residues? Xavier Gomis-Rüth. 

   o pdb -> mmcif : No TER records (mmdb fix)

   o Fix the python version of the JLigand interface.

   o Fix the python version of Sequencing interface, cootaneer_gui_bl

   o carbohydrate: Does it work in Python mode?

     A 310 in 3u0p

   o Do a better job when getting recent PDBe structures with refmac5 not in the path:

   o ligands validation paper: check the isolated dots for A 2748 in 3hmj

   o Do a better job when getting recent PDBe structures with refmac5 not in the path 
     (do it at work):

   o Bond colour slider (edit -> bond colours) is broken. 

* Fixed now.

   o the ball colour is not using the CA-only flag in colour by chain mode.

* Fixed?

   o Make the Display Manager open wider

* Done.

   o duplicate or create a fragment from a molecule, now quick-save-as.  The
     new molecules are not saved and are not in the state file - they should be.
     Frank von Delft.

* Done.

  o a good test for jiggle fit is 3GP, beam it in and jiggle-fit.. It
    wanders off.  Needs better map masking (mask the density of the
    atoms of residues-near-residue).

   o fix match-acedrg-dict-to-grade-dict-fails-to-write-dictionary.py (mac)

   o Look at gtk-demo for how to set the colour patch of button that makes a colour
     selection. Use it in map preferences. 

   o hilight interesting site (in python mode at least) gives big balls

* Done.

   o Fix sphere-refine-here-breaks-SS-bond.py (on atg) 

     Tricky. messed up structure - 669 C=O forms a peptide bonde with
     N of 671 (because 671 is too close to 669). 669 also forms a bond
     with 670. How do we stop this? 

   o on accept or reject moving atoms, clear the pull restraint.

* Done.
 
   o use refinement to make an cis-peptide - then relieve it - the
     refinement gui should track this - does it?

     graphics-info-modelling's "cis peptides"

   o read in ejd/BLG.pdb, look at the terminal - we only want/need one such warning:

WARNING:: failed to find dictionary entry index for GLB

   o the coot page should say "reference"

   o TRS in thumbnail view - e.g. in 3h6d.

* Done.

   o chiral restraints in 0BR (and others, presumably)

   o unsigned ints:

../../coot/git/coot/src/c-interface.cc: In function â€˜void set_display_only_model_mol(int)â€™:
../../coot/git/coot/src/c-interface.cc:5093:29: warning: comparison between signed and unsigned integer expressions [-Wsign-compare]

       if (i == imol)

* Done.
                
   o 3pt6 looks hideous when using PBDe -> Get From PDBe, but not from
     EDS.  Why?

   o pyrogen with no arguments should do a pyrogen --help

   o pyrogen restraints for 1SS: what is happening for the N1? Can
     RDKit detect that it might be chiral?  If so, and if the
     pdbx_stereo_config is missing, then make it a both.

   o 4ilh look at ligand A302 1FS: display geometry distortions:
     chiral tetrahedra are strange (missing 4th atom).

   o I want to turn on torsion restraints here:
     coot::geometry_distortion_info_container_t gdc = g.geometric_distortions(residue_p);

   o In Distance and Angles Geometry: "Update" should update the
     distances between atom sets after I've done a refinement.

   o User-defined distance restraints - say, between O and N in sheet,
     should be in use when we do sphere refine.

   o Does LPC work in thumbnailing?

   o OH of IGP in thumbnailing.

   o make_rtop_orth_for_jiggle_atoms() needs SO3 sampling.

   o Look at 15S in 4hhz: is the NH correctly positioned in the lbg view?

   o Refine a bit of of the DNA in 3pt6 and see that the nbc seem to be failing.

   o show bumps between bases in Environment Distances.

   o investigate why python doesn't use readline properly on hal

   o 4wtb has 2 data sets, they need to be parsed separately (clipper/cif).

   o does the phenix PDBe Python gui work as expected when there is no
     cif file at the url (e.g. the accession code is wrong?).

   o are the oxygens on a nitro O and O-? (eg ligand in 4CCC).

   o Sarah ligand: comp-id 23H: PDB accession code is 4MDS. Thank you Sarah. 
     It had tertiary amine with an amino group - it should be sp2
     hybridized, but was not (N+) - and rdkit failed.

   o write a store.py wrapper that transfers files to pc:~/store

   o pyrogen -r "" CCC does nothing and should return a non-zero exit status.

   o CA Zone -> Mainchain will change the sequence to ALA - this is wrong
     when the CAs have the right sequence.

   o valgrind when using PDBe recent structures.

   o does the PDBe Python gui work as expected when there is no refmac?

   o clean up coot-download usage in lbg-drag-and-drop.cc (need get_directory() function 
     which does the same as the scheme function). std::pair<bool, std::string> 

   o Alexander B Crash:

   o import an elbow dictionary cif as an "MTZ, cif. phs" file. Crash.

   o Fix up the map interface of HOLE.

   o is there anything going wrong with the minimisation of 
     can-you-minimise-this-qm-ext-frag-3-123.pdb?

   o Can you fit the ligand in 3fw1 (gleevec)?

   o in find ligands, the dialog expands the sections incorrectly when
     pulled.  Try making the dialog longer when you have 5 maps.

   o anisotropic refmac from coot interface: REFI BREF ANISO.

   o yellow/brown sulfurs, green for Cl, F, darkbrown Br, I purple, Orange P,
     purple Na, Li, K, dark green Mg, dark orange Fe.

   o Does refmac now work when you start it from a directory for which
     you don't have write permission?

   o consider ignoring waters in the clash score of auto-fit-rotamer
     and delete them if they bump into the sidechain after fittting.

   o Sphere refine doesn't use alpha helical restraints. It should.

   o Flev this: BLD in 4lsa

   o is sphericity test being applied for find waters? 

   o add a test for molecule(const std::vector<clipper::Coord_orth> &atom_list,
		             const std::string &residue_type, std::string atom_name,
		             std::string chain_id) - are the residue numbers correct?

   o with enhanced-ligand, do you get a sane code-path if you do 
     File -> SMILES?

   o pyrogen -M default.  Needs testing.

   o Do probe dots get updated locally after a sphere refinement?

   o Add a test: if pyrogen is built - does it run correctly? 
 
   o bonds to hydrogens should be thin in Colour by Chain mode

   o Do we get the correct hydrogen bonds with Acedrg dictionary (and
     pyrogen dictionary) for 824?

   o 1nlt: A351: there's a tangle at the Zinc.  Don't make a disulfide bond
     if there's a LINK to a ZN on this CYS.

   o Eleanor's problem: Make the difference maps peaks dialog general
     and link it to the register_interesting_positions_list functions.

   o compile without guile and run with --no-graphics (crashes on mac).

* No longer, but there's a problem (crash) reading template_key_bindings.py
  Need to test this on home/work computer.

   o Default for add waters should be something other than Pointer
     Atoms if possible.

   o Find overlapping atoms (on top of each others)

   o Ligand Check

   o add test for carbohydrate building.
  
   o Hydrogenate region when reduce is not found - give me a dialog.
     Or grey-out the function if it is not in the path.
 
   o review simple-restraints.cc:5131 H-bumps

   o at het_group_group() to API c.f. het_group_n_atoms()

   o always warn of cis-peptides in refinement dialog - Oliver Clarke 
     (pephaps in non-Pro cis-peptides)

   o Colour by chain: ligand 607A 3CJ in 4qyq has a triple bond to the S.  Why?
     Ligand drawn twice?

   o bundle raster3d.

   o stroke characters for HUD thumbnails?

   o given a SMILES string, is it in the PBD (SRS)?

   o launch coot from / and try to use pyrogen to build from a SMILES string

   o Give me a rotamer score in the refinement accept dialog. John Spurlino

   o refinement should refine CYS disulfides only when theres a DISU
     (or whatever) record.  Add a function to add a DISU.

   o experiment: use Rdkit with pdb perception to generate molecules and 
     compare them with molecules generated from reading the cif.

   o when you write out the PDB file, add a checkbox that asks to
     Rationalize Links? - which throws away links that are more than
     3A. Bob Nolte.

-----

   o permissions on Ubuntu 14.04

* Done.

   o Draw -> Additional Representation -> Ball and Stick - balls are
     too big.

* Done.

   o thumbnail for O 5463 in 3e5r:
     the N in the nicotinamide is N+2: incorrect!
     Also the Oxygens have charges and Hs.

* Done.

   o Does LBG File->Fetch molecule work now? Xamoterol?

* Yes, sort of - it depends in a complex way on libcurl (compilation?) 

   o absolutise() needs to be able to handle an empty string. Miguel Ortiz-Lombardia

* Done

   o Pro-CD -> CA and C NBC... what to do?

* Done.

   o planar peptide restraints: are the distortions correct?

* Done.


   o Tassos chat: put density correlation into coot.mini-rsr

* Done.


   o coot-download is created on starting coot.  It shold not be.  Marcin W.

* Done.

   o Glyo add NAG with ASN-NAG

 * Done.


   o move all the classes at the top of molecule-class-info.h to their
     own files.

* Done.

   o pepflip the N , flip the right one! (merely a keybinding thing)

* Done.

   o is nsteps_max 80 a good number for refinement? Consider increase.

* Done.


   o pdb redo script updates

* Done.

   o sphere refine on 2bmd 71: Where is the trans -> cis warning?

* Done.

   o change the monomer library to the CCP4 bzr repo version Robbie Joosten

* Done.

   o if coot-download/PDBe-XXX.cif is empty, it's OK to silently overwrite it.

* Done.

   o why doesn't Get Monomer -> MPD give me a thumbnail?

* Done - need sanitizeMol (for findSSSR) after removal of hydrogens

   o get rid of this debugging:

%%%%%%%%% calling fill_ghost_info() from c-interface.cc make_ncs_ghosts_maybe()

* Done.
