   For Release 0.8.9.1

   o map weights for cryo-EM carbohydrate fitting ::: 2

   o GM sigma and alpha for carbohydrate fitting ::: 2

   o enter an invalid SMILES into lidia ::: 1

   o the half-bonds of a C-S bond (e.g. CYS) doesn't add the correct atom indicies ::: 2

   o long bonds in bonds representation

   o when you reject intemediate atoms of a very bumpy solution, then it should delete, or undisplay
     the contact dots of generic display objects

   o reopen LSQ fit - the display says 24 but it chooses 0 for the reference molecule

   o coot-reduce: Add N-terminus amide Hydrogen atoms

   o refine: make sure we can correctly refine N-terminus amide hydrogen atoms

   o Replace residue -> ADE -> A -> crash

   o Make RCrane work again

   o Make Link needs a redraw after link has been made

   o Crash on read thing.map.gz as a map

--------------

   o adjust the lights in draw_display_list_objects() ::: 0.5

* Done
