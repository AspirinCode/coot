   o Does LBG File->Fetch molecule work now? Xamoterol?

   o Sphere refine doesn't use alpha helical restraints. It should.

   o with enhanced-ligand, do you get a sane code-path if you do 
     File -> SMILES?

   o pyrogen -M default

   o Add a test: if pyrogen is built - does it run correctly? 
 
   o bonds to hydrogens should be thin in Colour by Chain mode

   o Do we get the correct hydrogen bonds with Acedrg dictionary (and
     pyrogen dictionary) for 824?

   o 1nlt: A351: there's a tangle at the Zinc.  Don't make a disulfide bond
     if there's a LINK to a ZN on this CYS.

   o compile without guile and run with --no-graphics (crashes on mac).

* No longer, but there's a problem (crash) reading template_key_bindings.py
  Need to test this on home/work computer.

   o Default for add waters should be something other than Pointer
     Atoms if possible.

   o Find overlapping atoms (on top of each others)

   o Ligand Check

   o add test for carbohydrate building.
  
   o Hydrogenate region when reduce is not found - give me a dialog.
     Or grey-out the function if it is not in the path.
 
   o review simple-restraints.cc:5131 H-bumps

   o at het_group_group() to API c.f. het_group_n_atoms()

   o always warn of cis-peptides in refinement dialog - Oliver Clarke 
     (pephaps in non-Pro cis-peptides)

   o Colour by chain: ligand 607A 3CJ in 4qyq has a triple bond to the S.  Why?
     Ligand drawn twice?

   o bundle raster3d.

   o stroke characters for HUD thumbnails?

   o given a SMILES string, is it in the PBD (SRS)?

   o launch coot from / and try to use pyrogen to build from a SMILES string

   o Give me a rotamer score in the refinement accept dialog. John Spurlino

   o refinement should refine CYS disulfides only when theres a DISU
     (or whatever) record.  Add a function to add a DISU.

   o experiment: use Rdkit with pdb perception to generate molecules and 
     compare them with molecules generated from reading the cif.

   o when you write out the PDB file, add a checkbox that asks to
     Rationalize Links? - which throws away links that are more than
     3A. Bob Nolte.

   o permissions on Ubuntu 14.04

* Done.

   o Draw -> Additional Representation -> Ball and Stick - balls are
     too big.

* Done.


   o thumbnail for O 5463 in 3e5r:
     the N in the nicotinamide is N+2: incorrect!
     Also the Oxygens have charges and Hs.

* Done.
