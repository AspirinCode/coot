   For Release 0.8.7

   o Fetch molecule: acyclovir, (edit?) click Apply
 
   o Pyrogen chirality: Using CCD files as input, make a dictionary and either validate the coordinates 
     (dictionary vs actual) chiral volume or minimize and validate coordinates

   o Pyrogen: add command line arguement to keep the coordinates from the input CCD/mmcif file

   o when mutating to MSE atoms become HETATMs.

   o display ligand distortions, move and regularize, display ligand distortions. 
     Clear generic display objects -> not all graphics objects are removed - they 
     should be.

   o make a small buccaneer test

   o write a test that runs findwaters 

   o write a test that runs findligand

   o is git-revision-count correctly generated by make-dist-with-rev-and-ww2-put.sh?

   o for master: why doesn't OXT bond to C in GLU in 313 A of 5elv? [refinement branch]

   o remove debugging:

debug:: switch for sequence_view for imol 0 is 0x0

 o I like the interactive probe dots display a lot, but I really wish it was more interactive - would 
   it be possible to add a "live" probe dots display, that would refresh every second or two during 
   real space refinement and rotamer selection? This would be very helpful, particularly as a visual 
   guide during "rubber-band" manipulation of a structure when real-space refining a zone. Preferably 
   such a function would allow one to only display bad (pink) overlaps and h-bonds, as the full probe 
   dots display can be a little distracting.  -- Oliver Clarke

   o For goocanvas configuration, goo-canvas.m4, goocanvas uses pkg-config,
     use PKG_CHECK_MODULES,

   o resolve the GSL problem. If no GSL fail in configure?  Or perhaps correctly 
     conditionally compile without it (not usage of $prefix/bin/gsl-config)

   o Build with guile-gnome
