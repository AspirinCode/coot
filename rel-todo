   For Release 0.8.9.2


   o If residues are not consecutive and C-N is further apart than 2A don't add peptide flags.
     Currently seems to be 3.0A.

   o Add anom to PDB-redo output

   o maybe add external angle restraints

   o Where's my head and where am I looking? No need for orientation information.

   o copy fragment should have a "move it here" button.

   o Coot found no unexplained blobs" dialog should have a better title than "dialog1"

   o Jiggle fit uses linear interp? Jiggle fit should select backbone if fitting protein,
     ring atoms for RNA/DNA


   o this is running coot-refinement and pressing Apply in Lidia

   o Is cis-peptide markup getting passed to VR?  No, but it looks straightforward.

   o reposition the O on the current residue when adding a new one - Add Terminal Residue
     execute_add_terminal_residue()
