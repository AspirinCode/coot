   For Release 0.8.9.2

   o morph fit by secondary following the cryo-tutorial, morph secondary
     fit makes a helix go wonky [JED].

   o make restraints for a big protein, then delete them using ...
     delete deviants?

   o 5lc5 complex-1 do geometry graphs [Hannah Bridges]

   o crash on coot-reduce on luigi/3p4gA_dom1.pdb

   o Make Fe-S cluster SF4 (and FES?) drawn with bonds ::: 1

   o Fe-S needs to be rendered nicely in Bonds mode ::: 2

   o ball and stick to follow the colour of the atoms
     How about changing the background colour?

   o Add anom to PDB-redo output ::: 1

   o read SHELX.phs as a map ::: 1

   o click on the simple mutate on starting a session in coot-experimental
     (setup-mutate 0)
     ERROR:: invalid model molecule number in do_mutation() -1
     (do-mutatation "ALA" 0)

   o I want cis-trans to work on intermediate atoms, maybe crankshafting too.

   o Check that H on N moves on cis-trans

   o seems to be a failure of peptide plan restraints when residue type is a PRO.
     (converted to a ALA and things flattened out as expected).

   o dictionary_radii() for Hamish. Return something JSON.
     a dictionary? with a dictionary of atoms the the radius as the data

   o Eleanor's HIS. Add test ::: 1

   o Add LINK info to header browser. Other things? SSBOND, BIOMT? ::: 2

   o expand chis for TRP rotamers (maybe for refinement branch) ::: 2

   o "Last Only" button shouldn't animate (say with 100s of molecules). Tricky
     because gui update needs to be unlinked from undisplay update.
     ::: 2

   o Kill off Lidia -> View in Lidia, prodrg path ::: 0.5

   o Jiggle fit uses linear interp? Jiggle fit should select backbone
     if fitting protein, ring atoms for RNA/DNA ::: 2

   o maybe add external angle restraints ::: 2

   o Where's my head and where am I looking? No need for orientation
     information. Puntable ::: 1

   o Coot found no unexplained blobs" dialog should have a better title
     than "dialog1" ::: 0.5

* Done, needs testing.

   o Make RCrane work again ::: 6

   o this is running coot-refinement and pressing Apply in Lidia

    ::: 2

   o Is cis-peptide markup getting passed to VR?  No, but it looks
     straightforward. Puntable ::: 2

   o reposition the O on the current residue when adding a new one -
     Add Terminal Residue execute_add_terminal_residue() ::: 1

   o graphics_info_t::read_standard_residues() uses
     std::string standard_file_name = PKGDATADIR;
     it should use
     std::string l = package_data_dir();

  o Can you colour by ProSMART output - ask Rob for example. ::: 4

  o sideways histogram of map values when reading a map. ::: 1


------

   o copy fragment should have a "move it here" button. ::: 0.5

   o Draw -> Cell and Symmetry -> symmetry colour should follow the
     real symmetry colour. But now the symmetry colour is not dynamic.
     Swings and roundabouts.

     ::: 1
